# USC-AI-Sustainability-Challenge-2023

For this challenge, we propose an environment monitoring drone equipped with:
1. **Plant.id** for plant identification and health assessment
2. **ChatGPT** for foundational knowledge in response to collected plant data
3. **Tree-of-Thoughts** to design an expanded plan for ecology restoration.

## Project Summary
By combining drone data collection, advanced AI analytics, and a robust data dashboard, we at **EcoScan Technologies** provide advanced data and analytics to better monitor, predict, and protect vulnerable ecosystems. Our AI-powered software analyzes data from drone imagery to identify various native and invasive plant species, predict plant health, identify fire risks, and monitor soil properties.
